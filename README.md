# 📊 SQL Data Analysis Project

## 🚀 Objective

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to **data analysis using SQL**, covering the full pipeline from **data extraction** to **reporting**. It simulates a real-world scenario where data is pulled from **staging tables**, transformed through multiple layers of logic, and made analytics-ready in the **reporting layer** using views.

## 🔁 Workflow Overview

### 1. **Data Extraction**
- Data is pulled from **staging tables**, which act as the raw data source.
- These staging tables typically mirror upstream systems like **CRM, ERP, or flat file ingestions**.

### 2. **Data Transformation**
A variety of SQL techniques are applied to clean, shape, and enrich the data, including:

- 🧹 **Text Transformation**  
  Standardizing case, trimming, formatting strings, and handling nulls.
  
- 📊 **Aggregations**  
  Calculating KPIs such as total sales, count of transactions, and other metrics.

- 🔄 **Casting & Type Conversion**  
  Ensuring consistent and expected data types (e.g., converting text to dates or numbers).

- 🗓️ **Time Period Analysis**  
  Monthly, quarterly, and year-over-year comparisons using date functions.

- 🧱 **Data Segmentation**  
  Segmenting customers, products, or regions based on business logic.

- 🔍 **Advanced SQL Window Functions**  
  Using `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `SUM() OVER`, and more for in-depth trend and pattern analysis.

- 🔁 **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**  
  For breaking down complex queries and improving readability and modularity.

## 📈 Reporting Layer

- The **reporting layer only consists of SQL Views**.
- These views are designed to be **lightweight, read-optimized**, and directly consumable by tools like:
  - 📊 Power BI
  - 📉 Tableau
  - 🔍 Excel or any other BI platform

## 🧠 Business Use Cases Solved

- Identify top-performing products and customers
- Segment customers based on revenue contribution
- Analyze sales trends over time
- Detect data anomalies and outliers
- Create customer cohort and retention reports
- Apply ranking and filtering logic dynamically using SQL
